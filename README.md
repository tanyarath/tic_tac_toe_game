## 🧠 How It Works

- The board is a list of 9 positions indexed 0–8.
- Each player inputs a number from 1–9 representing a cell.
- The game checks for:
  - Win: Any row/column/diagonal with same symbol
  - Draw: When all 9 moves are made with no winner
- Player 1 uses **X** and Player 2 uses **O**.
